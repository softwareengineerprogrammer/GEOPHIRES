Modeling in Singh et al., 2025 predicts fluid loss of 0.36% to 0.49%.
Water Cost Adjustment Factor, 2, -- Local scarcity may increase procurement costs

Reservoir Volume Option, 1, -- FRAC_NUM_SEP: Reservoir volume calculated with fracture separation and number of fractures as input

Number of Fractures per Stimulated Well, 150, -- The model assumes a “High-Intensity” stimulation design utilizing 26 geometric stages with 6 clusters per stage (Extreme Limited Entry) (Fervo Energy, 2023).

Diagrams of fracture geometry, proppant placement, and thermal sweep confirm that effective heat exchange occurs in multistranded fracture propagations rather than the full geometric envelope.
