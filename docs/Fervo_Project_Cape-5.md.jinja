### Modeling Overview: A Consensus-Based Second-of-a-Kind Analog

This case study models a 500 MWe Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) project designed to represent a "Second-of-a-Kind" (
SOAK) deployment.
Rather than serving as an exact facsimile of Cape Station as built, this study estimates what a non-Fervo developer
could achieve on a geologically identical site, relying primarily on publicly available data and standardized
engineering estimates.
The model assumes the developer is a "fast follower": benefiting from the proof-of-concept established by Cape Station
Phase I but operating without access to Fervo’s private supply chain or proprietary optimization data.

**Public Data Reliance:** Inputs utilize exact values for publicly available parameters, such as geothermal
gradient and reservoir density.
Where data is proprietary, values are inferred from public announcements or extrapolated from standard industry
correlations.

**Conservative Constraints:** To ensure the model serves as a robust feasibility test, some inputs are intentionally
conservative compared to Fervo’s stated targets, such as drilling costs and water loss.

**Fast Follower Advantage:** By entering the market after Fervo’s initial de-risking campaigns, the modeled developer
avoids the high "tuition costs" of early experimentation.
For example, while Fervo’s initial drilling costs at Cape Station ranged
from [$9.4M down to $4.8M per well](https://houston.innovationmap.com/fervo-energy-drilling-utah-project-2667300142.html)
as they climbed the learning curve,
this model assumes a developer can bypass those initial high-cost outliers,
instead initiating their campaign at a stabilized commercial baseline (modeled here
at {{ '$' ~ drilling_costs_per_well_musd ~ 'M/well' }}, aligned with the NREL ATB and 2025 cost curves).
This reflects a developer who capitalizes on established industry knowledge to skip the "First-of-a-Kind" (FOAK)
premiums but has not yet achieved the fully optimized learning rates of a mature "Nth-of-a-kind" operator.

### Intended Use Cases

This case study is designed to function as a public utility for the geothermal sector, serving two primary roles:

**Industry Benchmark:** By relying primarily on verifiable public data and independent expert consensus, this model
establishes a transparent baseline for EGS viability.
It tests the premise that Fervo’s success at Cape Station is a replicable standard for the next-generation geothermal
industry.
The results serve as reference points for what is achievable using current technology in high-grade resources.

**Template for Resource Assessment & Custom Modeling:** The example input file (`Fervo_Project_Cape-5.txt`) is intended
as customizable template for modeling other resources.
Users can input local geologic data (gradient, rock properties) into this template to evaluate how a Cape Station-style
design would perform in different geographies (e.g., Nevada vs. Utah vs. International).
Different plant sizes and performance targets can be modeled by adjusting the number of production wells, fractures per well,
and other technical & engineering parameters.
The model allows users to stress-test economic assumptions, such as the PPA price or Investment Tax Credit (ITC), to see
how policy changes impact the feasibility of replicating this design elsewhere.

### Calibration with Fervo-implemented Field Design

[Designing the Record-Breaking Enhanced Geothermal System at Project Cape](https://www.resfrac.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Singh-2025-Fervo-Project-Cape.pdf) (Singh et al., 2025)
describes reservoir modeling (ResFrac) that informed the Cape Station field implementation[^field-implementation-configuration-note].

[^field-implementation-configuration-note]: Note on Configuration: While the specific Bearskin and Gold pads (Phase II) utilize an inverted 2:3 ratio (3 injectors for 2 producers), this case study assumes the 3:2 ratio identified in the paper's optimization studies ("Study 1") represents the standard repeating module for the full-scale 400+ MWe system. The higher injector count in Phase II is interpreted as a transient requirement for field delineation and initial pressure support (boundary conditions) rather than the long-term commercial standard.

#### Bench Design and Well Spacing

Figure 7 in Singh et al., 2025 (below) shows the well and bench spacing for the Cape Station field design.[^fig-7-note]
Each bench consists of 5 wells, with 2 injectors and 3 producers.
This ratio is encoded by the case study's `Number of Injection Wells per Production Well` parameter (see [Well Bores Parameters](#well-bores-parameters-section)).

The Singh et al. paper models separate upper and lower benches.
GEOPHIRES v3.11 does not support wells with different depths, so the case study's `Reservoir Depth` parameter is
set to a value nominally representing an approximate average depth between the upper and lower benches.
See the [Technical & Engineering Results section](#technical-and-engineering-results-section) for relevant temperature results.

![Singh et al. (2025), Figure 7](_images/singh-et-al-2025_fig-7_well-and-bench-spacing.png)

[^fig-7-note]: The original figure has been cropped and modified to display: "500 ft horizontal" instead of "700 ft horizontal" and "Inter-bench spacing: Vertical spacing between injectors: 700 ft"; per the Conclusions section of the paper: "Based on the results from the study and additional risk analysis, the 500 ft x 200 ft well spacing with a bench spacing of 700 ft was implemented in the field development." (p. 19).

#### Fracture Geometry

Figure 2 in Singh et al., 2025 (below) shows the ResFrac simulated fracture geometry. This figure, along with the bench design in Figure 7,
informed the case study's `Fracture Shape`, `Fracture Width`, `Fracture Height`, and `Number of Fractures per Stimulated Well` parameters (see [Reservoir Parameters](#reservoir-parameters-section)).

Note that the case study does not attempt to strictly replicate the paper's fracture geometry;
rather, the paper specifications were used to derive approximations and/or constraints on parameters whose final values
were ultimately refined based on holistic techno-economic considerations. For example, the intra-bench horizontal well spacing
of 500 ft dictates that fracture half-lengths must be at least 500 ft in order to achieve flow between injectors and producers.
Thus, a minimum fracture length of 1000 ft (305 m) is required (assuming that fractures propagate approximately symmetrically in the horizontal axis),
reflected in the case study's `Fracture Width` parameter value.

Similarly, the intra-bench vertical spacing of 200 ft (61 m) dictates that the fracture height must be at least 200 ft[^intra-bench-vertical-spacing-note].
The case study's `Fracture Height` value was formulated by starting with 61 m and then iteratively uprating until a total effective fracture surface area per well was achieved
that produces results consistent with the paper simulation and other reference values.
The uprated value is also supported by Figure 2's fracture geometry visualization indicating fracture height exceeding intra-bench vertical spacing.

[^intra-bench-vertical-spacing-note]: Note: unlike horizontal propagation, vertical fracture propagation is assumed to be asymmetrical in the upwards direction per "fracture propagation model with uniform frac gradient and no layering will tend to predict fracture growth directly upwards." (p. 3) and fracture geometry shown in Figures 1 and 2.

#### Simulation Comparison

An equivalent GEOPHIRES simulation was run using the case study's reservoir engineering parameters, with the following modifications to align with Singh et al.'s modeling scenario:

{{ reservoir_engineering_reference_simulation_params_table_md }}

The following table compares the average production temperature profile from the "700 ft bench spacing" scenario in Singh et al. with the GEOPHIRES simulation.
Note that both figures show temperature in Fahrenheit rather than Celsius.

{# @formatter:on #}

While the initial and final (Year 15) temperatures are consistent, the production curves exhibit distinct profiles due to the different modeling approaches:

1. **Reference Simulation (Left):** The Singh et al. (2025) curve reflects a fully coupled numerical simulation (ResFrac) that accounts for complex fracture heterogeneity, inter-well interference, and variable flow paths. The gradual decline starting around Year 3 indicates thermal dispersion, where cold injection fluid mixes with hot reservoir fluid along faster flow paths earlier in the project life.
1. **GEOPHIRES Simulation (Right):** The GEOPHIRES result utilizes the Gringarten (1975) analytical solution for flow in fractured rock. This model assumes a uniform thermal sweep across an idealized fracture surface. Consequently, it maintains a flat, maximum production temperature for a longer duration until the cold front reaches the production well (thermal breakthrough), resulting in a sharper, later decline.

Despite these structural differences, the comparison supports the physical plausibility of the case study's reservoir engineering parameters,
as the Year 1 and Year 15 thermal endpoints align closely with the numerical simulation baseline.

However, the analytical Gringarten model's thermal plateau yields a higher aggregate heat extraction than the numerical model's
gradual decline, representing an optimistic upper bound on performance compared to the conservative heterogeneity
modeled in ResFrac.
To bound this risk, an alternative GEOPHIRES simulation was modeled using the ResFrac profile[^upp-resfrac-profile-note].
Results indicated that to offset the dispersion penalty under heterogeneous flow conditions, the project would require
a higher initial reservoir temperature (achieved via deeper drilling) to compensate for the loss of the thermal plateau.

to view a variant GEOPHIRES scenario (`Fervo_Project_Cape-6 Variant: ResFrac Profile + Hotter/Deeper Scenario`)
for a 100 MWe average net production project with a 3 km well depth, yielding approximately 15°C higher production temperatures.

[^upp-resfrac-profile-note]: The simulation utilized GEOPHIRES's [Generic User-Provided Temperature Profile reservoir model](https://softwareengineerprogrammer.github.io/GEOPHIRES/Theoretical-Basis-for-GEOPHIRES.html#reservoir-models) with temperature data derived from Figure 18 in Singh et al. (2025).

The calibration simulation above represents a 15-year unmitigated thermal decline without redrilling.
In the full case study results, the model includes redrilling events that restore production temperature when drawdown thresholds are reached,
resulting in the cyclical profile shown in the [Production Temperature section](#production-temperature-profile-section) below.

#### Production Temperature Profile

<img src="_images/fervo_project_cape-5-production-temperature.png" class="no-active" style="max-width: 66%" />

The production temperature profile exhibits distinctive cyclical behavior driven by the interaction between wellbore physics and reservoir thermal evolution:

1. **Thermal Conditioning (Years 1–6)**: The initial rise in production temperature, peaking at approximately 203°C, is driven by the thermal conditioning of the production wellbores. As hot geofluid continuously flows through the wells, the wellbore casing and surrounding rock heat up, reducing conductive heat loss as predicted by the Ramey wellbore model.
2. **Reservoir Drawdown (Years 6–8)**: Following the conditioning peak, temperature declines as the cold front from injection wells reaches the production zone (thermal breakthrough), reducing the produced fluid enthalpy.
3. **Redrilling (End of Years 8, 16, 24)**: The model triggers a redrilling event when the next time step's temperature would fall below the threshold defined by the `Maximum Drawdown` parameter (shown as the dashed orange line). The production temperature does not necessarily actually reach the threshold; redrilling typically preemptively restores the wellfield before that occurs. The cost of these events is amortized as an operational expense over the project lifetime.

#### Power Generation Profile

<img src="_images/fervo_project_cape-5-power-production.png" class="no-active" style="max-width: 66%" />

Power generation is a direct function of production temperature, so the power production profile mirrors the thermal behavior described above. The graph shows both total (gross) electricity generation and net electricity generation after parasitic losses. The gap between the two curves represents the energy consumed by the circulation pumps.

The horizontal reference lines indicate the 500 MW net PPA minimum production requirement and the 600 MW nameplate capacity (combined capacity of the individual ORC units).

## Sensitivity Analysis

The following charts show the sensitivity of key metrics to various inputs.
Each chart shows the sensitivity of a single metric, such as LCOE, to the set of tested input values.
The leftmost chart column shows the parameter being tested and its baseline case study input value in parentheses.
The bars for each row show the deltas of the metric value from the baseline case study value for the values tested for
that parameter.
Green bars indicate favorable outcomes, such as lower LCOE or higher IRR, while gray bars indicate unfavorable outcomes,
such as higher LCOE or lower IRR.

Click the bars to view the sensitivity analysis result for the input value in the web interface.

Note that the sensitivity analysis scenarios do not necessarily conform to all constraints and assumptions documented in the case study methodology.
For example, scenarios for Bond Interest Rate have different weighted average cost of capital (WACC) values due to the effect of interest rate on WACC.
This is particularly relevant for technical parameters pertaining to reservoir engineering.
In a real-world design, these variables are physically coupled; for instance, targeting a higher production flow rate
would typically necessitate a larger fracture surface area to mitigate the resulting acceleration in thermal drawdown.
See the [discussion of flow rate below](#impact-of-flow-rate-on-project-economics-section).

         class="sensitivity-chart-print">

#### Impact of PPA Price on LCOE

The sensitivity analysis reveals a positive correlation between the Power Purchase
Agreement (PPA) price and the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE). While counterintuitive, this is a function of SAM
Economic Models treating federal and state income taxes as operating cash outflows.

In SAM Economic Models, the PPA price is a fixed input that determines project revenue. A higher PPA price generates
higher taxable income, which in turn increases the project's annual income tax liability (a negative cash flow). Because
the LCOE calculation aggregates all lifetime project costs, including the tax burden, the additional tax costs incurred
from higher revenues result in a higher calculated LCOE. Conversely, a lower PPA price reduces taxable income, lowers
tax liability, and decreases the resulting LCOE.

### Impact of Flow Rate on Project Economics

Higher flow rate per production well does not necessarily result in improved project economics (e.g. lower LCOE or higher IRR).
Higher flow rates result in increased generation in the short term, but also cause faster thermal decline.
Additional make-up wells may need to be drilled to compensate for increased thermal decline and maintain a minimum net generation (redrilling),
the cost of which may offset incremental revenue from increased generation.
This tradeoff was considered in reservoir modeling that guided Fervo's field implementation (Singh et al., 2025).

## Variants

<a id="Fervo_Project_Cape-6-section"></a>

### 100 MWe Model (Phase I)

The case study also includes a 100 MWe model, `Fervo_Project_Cape-6`, with equivalent capacity to Phase I.
Note that like the 500 MWe model, `Fervo_Project_Cape-6` represents a SOAK project and not the real-world Phase I implementation as built by Fervo.
[Click here](https://gtp.scientificwebservices.com/geophires/?geophires-example-id=Fervo_Project_Cape-6) to view the
100 MWe model in the GEOPHIRES web interface.

Source code: [Fervo_Project_Cape-6.txt](https://github.com/softwareengineerprogrammer/GEOPHIRES/blob/main/tests/examples/Fervo_Project_Cape-6.txt)
and [Fervo_Project_Cape-6.out](https://github.com/softwareengineerprogrammer/GEOPHIRES/blob/main/tests/examples/Fervo_Project_Cape-6.out).

### Reduced Redrilling Scenario

[Click here](https://gtp.scientificwebservices.com/geophires?shared-geophires-result-id=4eb5e843-be61-4518-8fda-7d0b41348e53)
to view a scenario with reduced redrilling in the web interface, representing an effective longer well life compared to the base case.
Redrilling is reduced via greater effective fracture surface area per stimulated well, achieved by an increased number of fractures per well and greater fracture height.
Stimulation cost is increased to nominally reflect the larger required job size.

{# TODO port scenario to source code instead of out-of-band shared result
    (probably would want to generate similar to Fervo_Project_Cape-6 #}

### ResFrac Profile + Hotter/Deeper Scenario

[Click here](https://gtp.scientificwebservices.com/geophires?shared-geophires-result-id=834b0096-15b1-4dd3-b262-612e9df1342f)
to view the `Fervo_Project_Cape-6 Variant: ResFrac Profile + Hotter/Deeper Scenario` in the web interface.
Note that this scenario models two redrilling events (rather than three) and yields 100 MWe average net generation
(rather than 100 MWe minimum net generation), reflected in the power generation profile below.
