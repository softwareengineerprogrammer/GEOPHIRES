# GEOPHIRES Case Study: 500 MW EGS modeled on Fervo Cape Station

## Introduction

The GEOPHIRES example `Fervo_Project_Cape-4` is a case study of a 500 MWe EGS project modeled
on Phases I and II of [Fervo Energy's Cape Station](https://capestation.com/).

Key case study results include LCOE = {{ '$' ~ lcoe_usd_per_mwh ~ '/MWh' }} and IRR = {{ irr_pct ~ '%' }}.

### Modeling Overview: A Conservative, Second-of-a-Kind Analog

This case study models a 500 MWe Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) project designed to represent a "Second-of-a-Kind" (
SOAK) deployment.
Rather than serving as an exact facsimile of Cape Station as built, this study estimates what a non-Fervo developer
could achieve on a geologically identical site, relying primarily on publicly available data and standardized
engineering estimates.
The model assumes the developer is a "fast follower": benefiting from the proof-of-concept established by Cape Station
Phase I but operating without access to Fervo’s private supply chain or proprietary optimization data.

**Public Data Reliance:** Inputs utilize exact values for publicly available parameters, such as geothermal
gradient and reservoir density.
Where data is proprietary, values are inferred from public announcements or extrapolated from standard industry
correlations.

**Conservative Constraints:** To ensure the model serves as a robust feasibility test, some inputs are intentionally
conservative compared to Fervo’s stated targets, such as drilling costs and water loss.

**Fast Follower Advantage:** By entering the market after Fervo’s initial de-risking campaigns, the modeled developer
avoids the high "tuition costs" of early experimentation.
For example, while Fervo’s initial drilling costs at Cape Station ranged
from [$9.4M down to $4.8M per well](https://houston.innovationmap.com/fervo-energy-drilling-utah-project-2667300142.html)
as they climbed the learning curve,
this model assumes a developer can bypass those initial high-cost outliers,
instead initiating their campaign at a stabilized commercial baseline (modeled here
at {{ '$' ~ drilling_costs_per_well_musd ~ 'M/well' }}, aligned with the NREL ATB and 2025 cost curves).
This reflects a developer who capitalizes on established industry knowledge to skip the "First-of-a-Kind" (FOAK)
premiums but has not yet achieved the fully optimized learning rates of a mature "Nth-of-a-kind" operator.

### Intended Use Cases

This case study is designed to function as a public utility for the geothermal sector, serving two primary roles:

**Industry Benchmark:** By relying primarily on verifiable public data and independent expert consensus, this model
establishes a transparent baseline for EGS viability.
It tests the premise that Fervo’s success at Cape Station is a replicable standard for the next-generation geothermal
industry.
The results serve as reference points for what is achievable using current technology in high-grade resources.

**Template for Resource Assessment & Custom Modeling:** The example input file (`Fervo_Project_Cape-4.txt`) is intended
as customizable template for modeling other resources.
Users can input local geologic data (gradient, rock properties) into this template to evaluate how a Cape Station-style
design would perform in different geographies (e.g., Nevada vs. Utah vs. International).
Different plant sizes and performance targets can be modeled by adjusting the number of doublets, fractures per well,
and other technical & engineering parameters.
The model allows users to stress-test economic assumptions, such as the PPA price or Investment Tax Credit (ITC), to see
how policy changes impact the feasibility of replicating this design elsewhere.

#### Production Temperature Comparison with Singh et al., 2025

Figure 18 of Singh et al. (2025) illustrates reservoir modeling that informed the Cape Station field implementation. The following table compares the average production temperature profile from the "700 ft bench spacing" scenario in Singh et al. (2025) with an analogous GEOPHIRES simulation using the case study’s reservoir engineering parameters.

{# @formatter:on #}

While the initial and final (Year 15) temperatures are consistent, the production curves exhibit distinct profiles due to the different modeling approaches:

1. Reference Simulation (Left): The Singh et al. (2025) curve reflects a fully coupled numerical simulation (ResFrac) that accounts for complex fracture heterogeneity, inter-well interference, and variable flow paths. The gradual decline starting around Year 3 indicates thermal dispersion, where cold injection fluid mixes with hot reservoir fluid along faster flow paths earlier in the project life.
1. GEOPHIRES Simulation (Right): The GEOPHIRES result utilizes the Gringarten (1975) analytical solution for flow in fractured rock. This model assumes a uniform thermal sweep across an idealized fracture surface. Consequently, it maintains a flat, maximum production temperature for a longer duration until the cold front reaches the production well (thermal breakthrough), resulting in a sharper, later decline.

Despite these structural differences, the comparison validates the basis for the case study's reservoir engineering parameters, as the aggregate heat extraction and year-15 endpoint align closely with the numerical simulation baseline.

### Sensitivity Analysis

The following charts show the sensitivity of key metrics to various inputs.
Each chart shows the sensitivity of a single metric, such as LCOE, to the set of tested input values.
The leftmost chart column shows the parameter being tested and its baseline case study input value in parentheses.
The bars for each row show the deltas of the metric value from the baseline case study value for the values tested for
that parameter.
Green bars indicate favorable outcomes, such as lower LCOE or higher IRR, while gray bars indicate unfavorable outcomes,
such as higher LCOE or lower IRR.

Click the bars to view the sensitivity analysis result for the input value in the web interface.

### LCOE

**Impact of PPA Price on LCOE:** The sensitivity analysis reveals a positive correlation between the Power Purchase
Agreement (PPA) price and the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE). While counterintuitive, this is a function of SAM
Economic Models treating federal and state income taxes as operating cash outflows.

In SAM Economic Models, the PPA price is a fixed input that determines project revenue. A higher PPA price generates
higher taxable income, which in turn increases the project's annual income tax liability (a negative cash flow). Because
the LCOE calculation aggregates all lifetime project costs—including the tax burden—the additional tax costs incurred
from higher revenues result in a higher calculated LCOE. Conversely, a lower PPA price reduces taxable income, lowers
tax liability, and decreases the resulting LCOE.

Users may wish to perform their own sensitivity analysis
using [GEOPHIRES's Monte Carlo simulation module](Monte-Carlo-User-Guide.html) or other data analysis tools.

## Phase I 100 MWe Model

The case study also includes a 100 MWe Phase I model, `Fervo_Project_Cape-5`.
