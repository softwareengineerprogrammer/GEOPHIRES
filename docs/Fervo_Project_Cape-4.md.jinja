# Case Study: 500 MWe EGS modeled on Fervo Cape Station Phase II

The GEOPHIRES example `Fervo_Project_Cape-4` is a case study of a 500 MWe EGS project modeled
on Phase II of [Fervo Energy's Cape Station](https://capestation.com/).

Key case study results include LCOE = {{ '$' ~ lcoe_usd_per_mwh ~ '/MWh' }} and IRR = {{ irr_pct ~ '%' }}.

interactively explore the case study in the GEOPHIRES web interface.

## Methodology

Case study inputs are formulated using a combination of publicly available data, extrapolations, and estimates.
Financial results are calculated using
the [SAM Single Owner PPA Economic Model](https://softwareengineerprogrammer.github.io/GEOPHIRES/SAM-Economic-Models.html#sam-single-owner-ppa).

The case study is constructed to be representative of a 500 MWe EGS project similar to Cape Station,
although it is not intended to be an exact facsimile.
This is because not all relevant data points are publicly available (e.g. full PPA terms) while others may not be
applicable
outside of Cape Station's first-of-a-kind status (such as drilling costs of initial wells which were more expensive
at [$4.8–9.4M per well](https://houston.innovationmap.com/fervo-energy-drilling-utah-project-2667300142.html)).

The Inputs and Results tables document key assumptions, inputs, and a comparison of results with reference
values.
Note that these are not the complete sets of inputs and results, which are available in source code and
the [web interface](https://gtp.scientificwebservices.com/geophires/?geophires-example-id=Fervo_Project_Cape-4).

### Inputs

Exact values were used for publicly available technical and engineering parameters, such as reservoir
density ([2800 kg/m³](https://doi.org/10.31223/X52X0B)).
Some technical parameters were inferred with high confidence from publicly available data, such as geothermal
gradient ([74 ℃/km](https://pangea.stanford.edu/ERE/db/GeoConf/papers/SGW/2024/Fercho.pdf)) and well diameter.
Other parameters were extrapolated or speculatively estimated based on plausibility and/or compatibility with known
results, such as number of doublets.

### Sensitivity Analysis

The following charts show the sensitivity of key metrics to various inputs.
Each chart shows the sensitivity of a single metric, such as LCOE, to the set of tested input values.
The leftmost chart column shows the parameter being tested and its baseline case study input value in parentheses.
The bars for each row show the deltas of the metric value from the baseline case study value for the values tested for
that parameter.
Green bars indicate favorable outcomes, such as lower LCOE or higher IRR, while gray bars indicate unfavorable outcomes,
such as higher LCOE or lower IRR.

Click the bars to view the sensitivity analysis result for the input value in the web interface.

### LCOE

    <object data="_images/fervo_project_cape-4-sensitivity-analysis-lcoe.svg"
            type="image/svg+xml"
            class="sensitivity-chart-interactive"></object>

         alt="LCOE Sensitivity Analysis Chart"
         class="sensitivity-chart-print">

**Impact of PPA Price on LCOE:** The sensitivity analysis reveals a positive correlation between the Power Purchase
Agreement (PPA) price and the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE). While counterintuitive, this is a function of SAM
Economic Models treating federal and state income taxes as operating cash outflows.

In SAM Economic Models, the PPA price is a fixed input that determines project revenue. A higher PPA price generates
higher taxable income, which in turn increases the project's annual income tax liability (a negative cash flow). Because
the LCOE calculation aggregates all lifetime project costs—including the tax burden—the additional tax costs incurred
from higher revenues result in a higher calculated LCOE. Conversely, a lower PPA price reduces taxable income, lowers
tax liability, and decreases the resulting LCOE.

### IRR
